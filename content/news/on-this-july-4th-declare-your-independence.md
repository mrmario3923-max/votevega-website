An Independence Day Message from Jose Vega, LaRouche Independent Candidate, 15th CD in the Bronx
As we approach the anniversary of our nation’s formal Declaration of Independence to the world, on July 4th, 1776, it would behoove every U.S. citizen today to read that remarkable document, particularly the train of abuses noted for our separation from the British Monarchy.
Note not all, but some of those grievances noted by our revolutionary forefathers: “The History of the King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations…
—He has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance
—He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our Legislatures
—He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil
—For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world.”
Now consider how the United States has conducted itself on behalf of other nations. In Ukraine, we have sacrificed over 600,000 souls for the purpose of inflicting a “strategic defeat” on Russia with billions of dollars of weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin made a very generous and reasonable proposal to back out of Ukraine in the Spring of 2022 as long as certain security guarantees were agreed to, such as the obvious non-admission of Ukraine into NATO. That was squandered by disgraced British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in typical fashion of the Empire he serves, but with no opposition from the President of the United States.
In Southwest Asia, we have allowed a genocidal regime to use more destructive force than we did on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, to kill off innocent children and women who have been condemned for terrorist acts they themselves did not commit. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister overseeing that sadistic mass-murder, is now scheduled to address our Congress this month.
What exactly are the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence now, if not unfulfilled, hypocritical documents to the vast majority of the world? Is the current crop of presidential candidates presented to the U.S. electorate qualified to remedy this situation?
Those who organized the greatest conspiracy in all of history, and successfully won their independence from the greatest military power in history, made it clear, “That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”
I declare that it is not our duty to change the government of the United States, but to REMOVE those currently in charge of misrepresenting us on behalf of the Military-Financial Complex, Wall Street, and the corporate cartels that have hijacked U.S. policy and distorted our revolutionary humanist traditions. That’s why I’ve declared my independent candidacy for U.S. Congress against Richie Torres in the Bronx.
It is time that people elect themselves to take back their government.
You can help by financially supporting my campaign. I ask everyone that can do it to donate either $17.76, $176, or $1776 to my campaign this July, so that we can continue our fight in the Bronx.
I would then ask that everyone read the writings of Hamilton, Jay, Washington, and Ben Franklin, to understand the historical tradition of our country that has been stolen from you. There are now billions of people in the world in Africa, South America, and Asia, who aspire to create a new security and development architecture which will provide low-interest credit to develop their own nation’s economies.
Can we fulfill this wonderful opportunity that is presented to us today, avoid nuclear war, and create a community of sovereign nation-states as Franklin Roosevelt intended at the conclusion of World War II?
Will you declare your independence?
