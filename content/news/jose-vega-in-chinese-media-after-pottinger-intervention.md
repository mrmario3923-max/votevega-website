“He’s trying to lead us to war,” was the title of an interview conducted by China’s Global Times after Jose Vega and campaign activists Robert Castle and Simon Miller confronted the warmonger Matthew Pottinger at the Asia Society on July 2nd.
The interview was conducted on July 6, Beijing time.
Vega posted the recording on X and wrote:

**Global Times** reports that the trio was forcibly removed by security personnel at the venue. Vega was choked after falling to the ground while being manhandled by security, while Castle was violently aggressed for several minutes, including an episode where he was strangled in an elevator after an eyewitness had been told to leave the scene by the aggressor “security guards.” Police on the scene later conceded that the security’s violent and illegal behavior would justify the police taking them “away from the scene in handcuffs.”

Please watch the interview on the **[social media account of Global Times](https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23%E6%80%92%E6%96%A5%E7%BE%8E%E5%8F%8D%E5%8D%8E%E6%94%BF%E5%AE%A2%E5%BD%93%E4%BA%8B%E4%BA%BA%E4%B8%93%E8%AE%BF%23)**.

On July 5 Alex Lo wrote under the headline **[Why the Asia Society invited the wrong person to speak on China](https://www.scmp.com/opinion/article/3269343/why-asia-society-invited-wrong-person-speak-china)** an opinion piece for the ***South China Morning Post***, saying he thought the response of a member of the audience made perfect sense. He continues to quote from what Jose Vega said and mentions the belligerent behavior of the security policing the event.

Lo ends his piece by saying: *“If it were true to its mission, the [Asia] society should make amends, invite the guy back – whoever he is – and give him the floor this time.”*
