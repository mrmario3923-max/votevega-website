# Meet Your Neighbors: Melrose Community Canvass

There's no substitute for face-to-face conversations with the people we serve. Join Jose Vega and our volunteer team for a community canvass in Melrose, where we'll knock on doors, listen to residents' concerns, and share our vision for change.

## Why Canvassing Matters

- **Direct Democracy**: Meet voters where they are
- **Listen to Concerns**: Hear firsthand what issues matter most to families
- **Share Our Vision**: Explain how Jose's policies will benefit the community
- **Build Relationships**: Create lasting connections with neighbors

## What to Expect

We'll work in pairs, visiting households throughout the Melrose neighborhood. You'll have literature to share and talking points to discuss, but mostly we're there to listen and learn from the community.
