This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by Vega for Congress ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website located at votevega.nyc and any other Vega for Congress websites and online services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Site").

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Site to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
