# They Fear Real Change

When politicians from both parties unite to denounce you, you know you're over the target. These establishment figures have publicly attacked Jose Vega because his message of Medicare for All, Bronx reindustrialization, and peace through development threatens their corrupt system.

Their denouncements only prove we're fighting for the right things.
