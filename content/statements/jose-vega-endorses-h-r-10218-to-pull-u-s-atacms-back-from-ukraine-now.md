***As an independent candidate&nbsp;for U.S. Congress (14th CD), Bronx, NY in 2024, I fully&nbsp;endorse House Resolution 10218 to prohibit the transfer of Army Tactical Missile&nbsp;Systems (ATACMS) to Ukraine and for other purposes.&nbsp; It is critical now that the American people mobilize to prevent the escalation to nuclear war before, or after January&nbsp;20, 2025.&nbsp; This is especially urgent since military and foreign&nbsp;policy figures such as Statcom's&nbsp;Admiral Thomas Buchanan are now brazenly and recklessly discussing the possible use of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; Please join me in putting a stop to this insanity.&nbsp; Read and circulate the statement below from the LaRouche Organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;***

# Stratcom’s Adm. Buchanan Spills the Beans: U.S. preparing for Nuclear War!

**Use H.R. 10218 To Pull U.S. ATACMS Back from Ukraine Now!**

It is urgent that the American people mobilize to urge Congress to immediately **enact H.R. 10218, "To Prohibit the Transfer of Army Tactical Missile Systems to Ukraine (ATACMS) and for other Purposes"**, introduced by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA), and now before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. This is a matter of the utmost urgency, to turn the country from its current course of baiting Russia into nuclear brinkmanship and possible U.S. pre-emptive nuclear strike.

Even if HR 10218 is not passed, it is important to strongly promote it, to prevent the escalation to nuclear war before, or after, Jan 20, since key circles in the military and foreign policy establishment clearly believe it is possible to wage and win a nuclear war- and they will still be there after Jan. 20!&nbsp;

Needless to say, any exchange of nuclear weapons between the US and Russia would lead to the probable extermination of human life on this planet, despite the fact that some circles in the US military and foreign policy establishment, such as Adm. Thomas Buchanan, Director of the Plans and Policy Directorate of the U.S. Strategic Command, are willing to contemplate their possible use.&nbsp;

**Buchanan, at the Center for Strategic and International&nbsp; Studies (CSIS) Nov. 20, stated a nuclear exchange would be acceptable as long as the U.S. emerged with enough nuclear capability to hold post-war dominance:&nbsp; "I think everybody would agree if we have to have an exchange, then we want to do it in terms that are most acceptable to the United States. So it's terms that are most acceptable to the United States that puts us in a position to continue to lead the world, right?” (See reverse of this leaflet for details).**

**Are Members of Congress aware of these chilling comments by the Director of Plans and Policy of the U.S. Strategic Command, which are not obviously merely his personal views, but shared by others in the foreign policy and military establishment? That they mean the abandonment of the policy that “nuclear war cannot be won and therefore must not be fought”? But rather, “We must plan for nuclear war if that’s what it takes to maintain U.S. global dominance”?**

Helga Zepp-LaRouche, founder of the Schiller Institute, and Scott Ritter, former U.S. Marine and U.N. weapons inspector, have called for a maximum citizens’ mobilization to repudiate this criminal thinking, worthy of a Nuremberg docket. **Call your members of Congress now, at (202)**** ****225-3121****!** Tell them to back H.R. 10218 now! And tell them to stay on the case beyond this session of Congress, in whatever actions are needed to pull the U.S. out of its present course to nuclear war.

## **Getting the American People ‘Nuclear War Ready’**

Schiller Institute founder Helga Zepp-LaRouche is right to demand a national and international hue and cry be raised over the insanity in U.S. policy revealed by Rear Adm. Thomas R. “TR” Buchanan, Director of U.S. Strategic Command’s Plans and Policy Directorate, in addressing a Nov. 20 at a conference at Kissinger’s old haunt, Georgetown University’s Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS). Buchanan there stated that the U.S. should be prepared to use nuclear weapons, if the global leadership role of the United States was at stake.

Buchanan used his keynote address to the CSIS conference to kick off—with the enthusiastic backing of his hosts from the CSIS Project for Nuclear Issues (PONI)—a national debate on the proposition that “nuclear weapons use is no longer unimaginable,” as opposed to the still-official policy that “nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.” Such a debate is needed “to raise the nuclear IQ of not only our military leaders, but our policymakers, our leadership, Capitol Hill, and the public,” he proposed.

In introducing Buchanan, moderator Heather Williams, the Director of the PONI project and a consultant to STRATCOM’s Strategic Advisory Group, reported that a theme of discussions in earlier panels that morning was that “nuclear weapons use is no longer not imaginable.” Williams, who participated actively with Buchanan in the discussion to get Americans to “think the unthinkable,” has extensive links into British policy-making circles: she was an advisor to the House of Lords and is an associate fellow at London’s oldest imperial think tank, Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), as well as being an associate professor at King’s College London, where she also received her PhD from the Department of War Studies.

In his prepared speech and discussion which followed with Williams, Buchanan admitted that “technically” the U.S. is not at war with adversaries Russia, China, Iran or North Korea. Congress hasn’t declared war, but we are in a strategic environment in which “we need to be ready. And by ready, I mean our services need to be ready,” he argued. Buchanan urged PONI and other policymakers to strategize on what “types of things that resonate with the American people” could help them understand why StratComm must prepare for the use of nuclear weapons. He asked: What are we “missing in terms of capturing the nation’s attention? … Is it because the talk of nuclear weapons is verboten? Is it because we don’t want to consider the possible outcomes? Is it because … we don’t want to think about it?”

Why must Americans think about this? Asked to define what it means to discuss “winning” a nuclear war, Buchanan demurred that we would not want to have a nuclear exchange, but:

“I think everybody would agree [that] if we have to have an exchange, then we want to do it in terms that are most acceptable to the United States … terms … that put us in a position to continue to lead the world, right? So we’re largely viewed as the world leader.

“And do we lead the world in an area where we’ve considered [to have a] loss? The answer is no, right? And so it would be to a point where … we’d have to have sufficient capability. We’d have to have reserve capacity. You wouldn’t expend all of your resources to gain winning, right? Because then you have nothing to deter from at that point. So a very complex problem.”

Weapons producer Northrop Grumman Corp. kindly paid for this discussion.

Helga Zepp-LaRouche, in discussion with associates on Dec. 9 emphasized: "Buchanan's statement is, in its enormity, so unbelievable that you would really think that this should have been the number-one news item all over the world. But it was completely covered up. No Western media found it worth discussing. No politician in the West thought it was necessary to comment on. I think that that is so unbelievable, because in all aspects, it is a violation of the Nuremberg Code: that you cannot prepare a war of aggression, and for sure not one with nuclear weapons, which means the end of all life on the planet if it comes to that."
