# Asset Loading Fixes - Jose Vega Campaign Website

## Issues Identified and Fixed

When you uploaded the website, the assets weren't loading properly. Here's what was wrong and what I've fixed:

### 1. Header Visibility Issues
**Problem**: Headers in both `index.html` and `statements.html` had CSS transforms that were hiding them.
**Fix**: Added inline styles to make headers visible with `position: relative; transform: none; background-color: #000000;`

### 2. Missing Logo in Navigation
**Problem**: The main `index.html` had a placeholder comment instead of the actual logo.
**Fix**: Added the logo image (`images/main_logo_2.png`) to the navigation header.

### 3. Broken Image References
**Problem**: Several images referenced in `index.html` didn't exist:
- `stop-genocide.png`
- `peace-development.png`
- `rebuild-bronx.png`
- `jose-vega-portrait.jpg`

**Fixes**:
- Replaced missing issue icons with FontAwesome icons (peace hand, globe, hammer)
- Replaced missing portrait with existing `hero-image-2.jpg`

### 4. Navigation Links
**Problem**: Links to statements page were pointing to anchor `#statements` instead of the actual page.
**Fix**: Updated navigation and button links to point to `statements.html`

### 5. Missing CSS Button Styles
**Problem**: Several button classes used in HTML were missing from CSS (`btn-gold`, `btn-green`, `btn-dark-blue`).
**Fix**: Added comprehensive button styles with hover effects and gradients.

### 6. Statements Page Styling
**Problem**: The statements page needed proper styling for the blog-style layout.
**Fix**: Added extensive CSS for:
- Statement cards with hover effects
- Featured statement styling
- Badge colors for different categories
- Responsive design
- Professional typography

## New Deployment Package

Created: `votevega-website-fixed.zip`

This package contains all the fixes and should deploy properly on any static hosting service. All assets should now load correctly including:
- Custom fonts (Vanguardia family)
- Images and logos
- CSS styling
- Bootstrap components
- FontAwesome icons

## Deployment Instructions

1. Upload the entire contents of `votevega-website-fixed.zip` to your hosting service
2. Ensure the file structure is maintained (css/, fonts/, images/, js/ folders)
3. Set `index.html` as your default/landing page
4. The site should now load properly with all assets working

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Logo appears in navigation
- [ ] Header is visible and styled correctly
- [ ] FontAwesome icons show in the issues section
- [ ] All buttons have proper styling and hover effects
- [ ] Statements page loads with proper styling
- [ ] Navigation between pages works

The main cause of your asset loading issues was likely the CSS transforms hiding the header and missing image files. These fixes should resolve all deployment problems.
